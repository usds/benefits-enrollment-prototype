</li>
<li>
<p>I’m giving to the benefits agency our rights to pursue and get any money from other health insurance, legal settlements, or other third parties. I’m also giving to the the benefits agency rights to pursue and get medical support from a spouse or parent.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I know that I must tell the benefits agency within 30 days if anything changes (and is different than) what I wrote on this application. I can visit the office or call to report any changes.

</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do if I think my eligibility results are wrong?</p>
<p>If you don’t agree with what you qualify for, in many cases, you can ask for an appeal. Please review your eligibility notice to find appeals instructions specific to each person in your household who applies for coverage, including how many days you have to request an appeal. Here’s important information to consider when requesting an appeal:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can have someone request or participate in your appeal if you want to. That person can be a friend, relative, lawyer, or other individual. Or, you can request and participate in your appeal on your own.
</li>
<li>If you request an appeal, you may be able to keep your eligibility for coverage while your appeal is pending.</li>
<li>The outcome of an appeal could change the eligibility of other members of your household.
To appeal your benefits eligibility results, visit the website, local office, call or via mail.</li>
