		<h1>This site hosts a multi-benefit application and enrollment <a href="welcome.html">prototype</a>.</h1>

		<p>This prototype has been designed with applicants for critical public benefit programs to model how to create simpler, user-centered multi-program applications.</p>

		<p>This is a template that local benefits administrators can customize for their enrollment programs. It is not a real application: <strong>no data entered on these pages will be shared or stored</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p class="usa-font-lead">Building on the work of Medicaid modernization, the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicaid and Medicare</a> and the <a href="https://www.usds.gov/">U.S. Digital Service</a> have been working to use the tools of technology and design to <strong>improve how benefit applicants get access to critical services.</strong></p>

		<p>Our team began by exploring the current state of benefit enrollment and delivery across agencies and states in an extensive qualitative user research field study. <a href="{{ base }}assets/discovery-findings-mapping-enrollment-Nov2016.pdf">See the report of our findings</a>.</p>

		<p>From here, our team began working closely with local benefit program administrators to identify tools to help accelerate their program modernization efforts. </p>

		<h2>About this prototype</h2>

		<p class="usa-font-lead">This prototype demonstrates a user-centered enrollment model that leverages data sharing between agencies to <strong>minimize the burden on applicants in determining program eligibility</strong>.</p>

		<p>In our research, we saw a common need from state programs for an online application template which offices can customize to meet their own policy and user requirements.</p>

		<p>The alpha version of the prototype is designed to model how one or more applicants can apply for SNAP and/or Medicaid — two of the largest programs with demographic eligibility overlap.</p>

		<h2>What does “alpha” mean?</h2>
		<p class="usa-font-lead">The alpha stage of product development is a short phase after a deep discovery in which teams <strong>quickly design, build, and test concepts with users</strong>.</p>
		<p>The aim of the alpha phase is to:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Show that project is technically feasible</li>
			<li>Build and test early versions of a product with real users</li>
			<li>Gather feedback from stakeholders and key partners to identify improvements for a beta release</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In other words: this prototype is a work-in-progress... and we want your help making it better.</p>
